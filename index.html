  My name is Taylor Salazar. I am currently a 16 year old junior and I am hoping to major Computer/Science in college. 
  I am the oldest of my family with my brother being 14 years old. I enjoy playing sports and doing other hobbies such as 
  going to the trampoline park and practicing flips, or playing water sports.
